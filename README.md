**Introduction**

This is an Gnerative AI project in which, using Leap AI API using Python involves creating images based on textual prompts. First, I obtain an API key from my Leap AI account, which is used to authenticate the requests. 
then set up the API endpoint and define the payload, which typically includes the text prompt and other parameters like image size. Using the 'requests' library in Python, you send a POST request to the API endpoint 
with the prompt. The server processes the request and returns a response containing the generated image or an error message if the request fails.

**Image Generation**

This code defines two functions: generate_image and get_inference_job. The generate_image function initiates the image generation process by making a POST request to the API, providing a model ID and a prompt. It retrieves the inference ID and the initial status of the inference job.

The get_inference_job function checks the status of the inference job by making a GET request to the API, providing the model ID and the inference ID. It retrieves the updated status and the generated images (if available).

The code calls the generate_image function with a specific model ID and a prompt describing the desired image. It then enters a loop that repeatedly checks the status of the inference job until it is finished.

Once the inference job is finished, the code retrieves the generated images using the get_inference_job function.

The code displays the generated images inline within the notebook using the IPython library.

**Modifying Prompts**

To generate different types of images, you can modify the prompts in the code. The prompts should provide descriptive and detailed descriptions or concepts related to the desired image. Feel free to experiment with various prompts to generate images based on your preferences.
